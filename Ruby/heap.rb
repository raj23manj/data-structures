# this is implemented as Binary tree, not as BST
#Rules:
# top to bottom and from left to right, the nodes are filled

# two versions
# Min heap and Max Heap
# no comparion of the sibling is required
# if comparision is failed it swaps the node values

# Min Heap:
# a child must always be greater than it's parent

# Max Heap:
# a child must always be less than it's parent

#implemenation done in Priority queue's, based on priority node changes
