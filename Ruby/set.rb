# is not an array or stack or queue.
# it is container containing objects randomly at at random positions.
# a set will not contain a duplicate object's
# searching (contains) in a set is very fast compared to other data structures. (no linear search or any other searches)
# No index like array, no sequence, no key's
# set implementation can be done with Hash Table, along with hash position
