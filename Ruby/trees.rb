# Binary Tree, a tree structure with max of two childrens and a min of zero childrens
# a node without children is a leaf node

# this is used for binary search tree

# it has to be sorted
# also known as sorted tree or ordered tree

# Rules for BST
# left child node must be less than it's parent
# right chile tree must be more than it's parent

# left child tree < parent < right child tree

# no duplicate keys
# when new node is added compare begins from root node

# BST are advantageous for:

# Fast Insertion, fast retrieval
# BST that are balanced with equal levels are Red-Black Tree, AVL tree alogorithms
