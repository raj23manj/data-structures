# used to map nodes
# a complex system of inter connected nodes
# equal to Graph theroy

# A graph is made up of a set of vetices(nodes) and a set of edges(lines connecting them)


#Directed Graph:
# a edge directed in one way is a directed graph
# one way out and multiple ways in

# undirected Graph
# in both directions

# Weights:

# Distance between nodes
